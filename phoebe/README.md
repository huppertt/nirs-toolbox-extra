# PHOEBE

PHOEBE (Placing Headgear Optodes Efficiently Before Experiment) is a MATLAB GUI application that measures and displays the optical coupling between fNIRS optodes and the scalp of a subject in real time.

The primary goal of PHOEBE is to help the experimenter optimize signal quality of fNIRS headgear in a time efficient manner. Details on the methods used to quantify the scalp-optode coupling is described in the paper linked at the bottom of this page.
