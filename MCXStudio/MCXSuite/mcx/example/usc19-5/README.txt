== USC 19-5 Brain Atlas Photon Simulations ==

In this example, we demonstrate light transport simulation in a full-head 
atlas template(USC 19.5 year group [Sanchez2012]).

To run the simulation, you must first unzip the domain binary file using 
unlzma on Linux or 7-zip on Windows. For example, on Linux:

 unlzma USC_19-5_atlas_vol.bin.lzma

This demo is identical to the MCX simulation used for Fig.9(a) in
TranYan2019(submitted).
