Contributors:

Louis Gagnon of MIT and the MGH-Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging contributed code for using 
short separation measurements to regress physiological interference while simultaneously estimating 
stimulus evoked hemodynamic responses (Gagnon2011, Gagnon2012). See hmrDeconvTB_3rd(), 
hmrDeconvTB_SS3rd(), hmrDeconvTB_SS3rd_Highest().

Rob Cooper while at the Martinos Center contributed to several functions related to correcting 
motion artifacts. See hmrMotionCorrectSpline().

Katherine Perdue of Dartmouth College contributed code for identifying motion artifacts based on a 
standard deviation threshold to complement the amplitude threshold. See hmrMotionArtifact().

Qianqian Fang of MGH-Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging contributed matlab routines from his 
toolboxes iso2mesh and ezmapper to AtlasViewerGUI. The iso2mesh routines are used to resample dense 
meshes to sparser ones when converting from freesurfer to viewer file formats. The ezmapper library 
routines are used to convert digitized points acquired with ezmapper tool to the text format which 
AtlasViewer can read.

Juliette Selb of the Martinos Center contributed to several functions related to correcting motion 
artifacts. See hmrMotionCorrectSpline().

Sabrina Brigadoi, while visiting from University of Padova, contributed to functions related to 
correcting motion artifacts. She adopted the wavelet method described by (Molavi2012) for Homer2. 
See hmrMotionCorrect_Wavelet(). She also contributed hmrMotionCorrect_Cbsi() as adapted from (Cui2010).

Chris Aasted contributed a tool for AtlasViewerGUI that will plot the variability of probe placement 
across a group of subjects. Assuming you have a group of subjects for which you digitized the optode 
coordinates, this is useful to ascertain if the placement was uniform across subjects.

Jichi Medical University

Daisuke Tsuzuki and Ippeita (Pepe) Dan (Functional Brain Science Lab) are helping to incorporate their 
registration tools into Homer2 (Tsuzuki2012). These tools will be part of the AtlasViewerGUI tool.

University Hospital Zurich

Felix Scholkmann and Martin Wolf of the University Hospital of Zurich contributed a motion correction 
algorithm using splines, as described in (Scholkmann2010). See hmrMotionCorrectionSpline().
