v1.0.3

Commit note: "
Modified save file button to detect and notify when a file already exists. Asks
user whether they want to overwrite the existing file.

=================================
v1.2

Commit Note: "
Changes to generate monte carlo simulation output and 
sensitivivity profile. Now if subject's digitized points 
exist, they are displayed instead of the default atlas head. 
The user then has to register atlas to subject space and 
AtlasViewerGUI will display atlas surfaces in subject 
digitized point space. If the probe is also digitized 
then user doen't need to import probe only bring it to the 
subject's surface by clicking the Register Probe button.  

Consolidated the various ways of importing probe into 
one menu option (used to have LoadProbe and ImportProbe) 
and function. 

Got rid of references to SDgui's global SD structure in 
and the function AtlasViewerGUI_SDgui. It isn't needed. Now 
SDgui communicates with AtlasViewerGUI by updating 
atlasViewer.probe through the sd_data_Set* functions (and this 
should be the only place this is done.

===================================
v1.2.1

Commit Note: "
1. Got rid of Update sensitivity button and instead sensitivity 
updates automatically when edit channels sensitivity is changed
to a different channel. 

2. Name of Generate Sensitivity profile menu item changed to 
Generate/Load Sensitivity profile. Also it is automatically 
enabled when genForwardMatrix_new.mat is found after probe 
registration

3. Name of pushbutton Register Probe changed to Register Probe 
to Surface.

4. Fixed color problem with meas channels when updating sensitivity 
and hiding and then showing measurement channels.

5. Fixed noptorig not showing the correct number of optodes. noptorig 
is the number of optodes without dummy points if they exist. If  
spring registration isn't used it should just equal the total number 
of optodes.

Commit Note: "
"
-- Fixed incorrect text label for the detectors optodes table in SDgui.
-- Fixed crash when SDgui is closed as well as minor fixes: lack of semi colon
-- small fixes for Jay mesh.vertices
-- Fixed error in aal labels vertices. We weren't getting correct projection of optodes to cortex
-- Projecting optodes to cortex with no digitized points used to work then broke with last commit. 
Fixed in this commit
