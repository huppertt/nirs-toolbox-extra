<h1 id="Title" class="centered">Photon Migration Imaging Toolbox</h1>

<p>Diffuse optical tomography [DOT] is an emerging technique for non-invasive
medical imaging.  Using optical fibers, light is directed into biological
tissue.  As the light travels through the tissue it is scattered many
times and exits as a diffuse photon fluence.  The exiting photons
are collected and photo-detectors record the intensity.  The measured
data can then be interpreted to provide information about the optical
scattering and absorption of the region probed by the photons. If multiple
overlapping measurements are available, tomographic reconstruction
techniques can be used to produce three-dimensional images within the
region of interest. In addition, by operating at multiple wavelengths
within the tissue, the optical absorption coefficients can be related back
to the local concentration of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (or, equivalently,
to the total hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation).
These quantities, in turn, indicate local tissue metabolism.</p>

<p id="Description">The Photon Migration Imaging (PMI) toolbox
implements numerous algorithms for performing the forward and inverse
calculations associated with diffusive optical imaging. The toolbox is
implemented in <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">Matlab</a> 
and is (for the most part) platform independent.</p>

<p> Copies of the PMI Toolbox can be downloaded from the <a
href="http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~jstott/PMI/">PMI Toolbox
Website.</a> Installation instructions and sample code can be
downloaded from the same place.  We also maintain a listserver for
discussions between users of the PMI Toolbox and announcements relating 
to the toolbox.  To subscribe to the PMI listserver, send mail to
<a href="mailto:majordomo@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu">majordomo@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu</a>
with the text <code>subscribe pmi email_address</code> in the body of
the email where <code>email_address</code> is the email address you
wish to have the listserve emails sent to.</p>
