This directory contains a selection of Octave functions that were downloaded from
http://octave.sourceforge.net/signal/index.html and modified to
make them MATLAB compatible. They serve as drop-in replacement for
some functions in the Mathworks signal processing toolbox.

Note that the hilbert and hanning functions are not from the Octave toolbox, 
these have been taken from SPM (hilbert), or were handcrafted (hanning)
