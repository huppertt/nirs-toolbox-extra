= Validation of uniform planar source =

== Introduction ==

In this example, we test a simple widefield source -- uniform planar on a digimouse mesh model.
Three corners of the 3D quadrilateral are specified by srcpos, srcpos+srcparam1(0:2), srcpos+srcparam2(0:2).
The original mesh is re-tessellated after adding source nodes in addsource.m .
The digimouse mesh model can be downloaded at http://mcx.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?MMC/DigimouseMesh
