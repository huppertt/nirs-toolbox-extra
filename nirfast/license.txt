--- excoef.txt ---

Hemoglobin values from Scott Prahl found at http://omlc.ogi.edu/spectra/hemoglobin/summary.html.  Values were multiplied by 2.303 to convert from base e to base 10 and divided by 10,000 to convert from cm-1/M to mm-1/mM.

Water values from Hale and Query found at http://omlc.ogi.edu/spectra/water/data/hale73.dat.  Values were divided by 10 to convert from cm-1 to mm-1

Lipid values from Veen et al found at http://omlc.ogi.edu/spectra/fat/fat.txt.  Values were divided by 1000 to convert from m-1 to mm-1


--- mouse atlas ---

The mouse atlas was generated using information from the following:
